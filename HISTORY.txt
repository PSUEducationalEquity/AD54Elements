Changelog
=========

4.0 (2013-04-07)
----------------
* This version is focused on accessibility.  Due to the versions of jQuery needed, this version is for Plone 4.x+.  
* The pull down button didn't work for the blind, so that has been taken away.  If you use a keyboard to get to the searchbox you can escape by using the esc key, tab, or space bar buttons.  The tab or space bar buttons will take you to a spot where you can type in your search query.  
* Now if you click on the box you see the options and either choose and option or type in the box.  You can then also click outside of the pull down and it will go away.
